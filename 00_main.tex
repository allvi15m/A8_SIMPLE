\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a novel energy storage management (ESM) solution designed to optimize the use of grid-connected distributed energy resources (DERs) based on forecasted values of generation, load and real-time energy prices. The proposed control strategy aims to control the operations of the energy storage so that the total cost of using energy to serve the local load is minimized. The proposed solution generates a graph from the energy storage status and available data and uses A* search algorithm to find the optimum path through the grid. Seven day test results are presented and compared with two scenarios. The first scenario compares the A* based ESM with two base test cases considering net metering. The other scenario compares the A* based ESM with the same base test cases considering different cost for buying power from the grid and selling power to the grid. The pricing schemes used in the testing was obtained from Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E) \cite{pgne} and New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) \cite{NYISO2017}. The results  show substantial cost savings over the compared schemes.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper proposed a novel ESM aimed to determine the optimal use of ES. The ESM scheme is designed to optimize the charging and discharging of a grid connected energy storage by formulating the problem as a graph search and solving the graph search using A* search algorithm. The A* based ESM is tested using realistic data collected from the SUNGRIN project, NYISO, and PG\&E. It also considers both a net metering scenario and a sell back price different from the buying price of energy. The ESM shows a cost saving of 6.93\% to 43.48\% compared to the base test cases for the scenarios. The results show that the proposed method has the capability to adapt to various changing price profile and system status and provide a solution that reduces cost significantly. Future research will focus on developing an ESM capable of controlling multiple ES and additional  DERs taking into account system constraints.
