By defining the solution space with a combination of nodes and edges the optimization problem can be formulated as a graph search problem. At the start the starting node is determined by the current status of the system. Then the following nodes and edges are generated using the forecasted data available. A discrete set of endpoints are set as the goals.The A*  algorithm runs for all the nodes and the node with the lowest path cost is selected as the best end node and the trajectory of that node's path is selected as the optimum trajectory. The algorithm is represented in pseudo code as follows. \\
