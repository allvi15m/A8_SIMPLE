By defining the solution space with a combination of nodes and edges the optimization problem can be formulated as a graph search problem. At the start the starting node is determined by the current status of the system. Then the following nodes and edges are generated using the forecasted data available. A discrete set of endpoints are set as the goals.The A*  algorithm runs for all the nodes and the node with the lowest path cost is selected as the best end node. The shortest graph search path to that node is selected as the optimum path.

The following are the main steps of the search algorithm,

The EMS recalculates the optimum path using the search algorithm every time step based on the updated data of that time step.
